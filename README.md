## 🛠️ How It Works  

- **FlinkTab App** sends your pen/touch input to the **FlinkTab Server** over Wi-Fi  
- The server converts this input into real-time mouse/pen events on your PC  
- Your PC software receives these inputs just like from a real drawing tablet  

This architecture ensures **low latency** and smooth drawing performance.
